# Algorithms Notebook

This repo aims to be reference for different algorithms and other computer science problems. Current goal is to make the notebooks cover as many algorithms as possibel while being as descriptive as possible. This is in early development and (probably) contains a lot of mistakes. 

Any PR is welcome. Raise an issue if you find any mistakes.
